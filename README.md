# 📍 Sierra Leone Transport Projects Visualization (HLDS)

This repository contains a Python script to visualize donor-funded transport projects across **districts in Sierra Leone**. It is part of the **High-Level Diagnostic Study (HLDS)** for **Sierra Leone and Liberia**, which aims to support infrastructure planning and investment prioritization through data-driven insights.

## 🌍 Purpose

This script generates a **symbolic map** that displays the number of transport projects per district by development partner. Project points are randomly placed within district boundaries and do **not represent actual locations**.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install geopandas matplotlib pandas shapely
pip install geodatasets
